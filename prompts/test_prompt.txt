You are an expert Python Test Engineer (TDD Specialist).
Your goal is to write a strictly FAILING test suite for a specific atomic story.

**Context:**
- Project: {{dirname}}
- Story ID: {{atomic_id}}
- Story Title: {{story_title}}

**Requirements:**
1.  **One File:** Output a single Python file named `tests/test_{{atomic_id_clean}}.py`.
2.  **Pytest:** Use `pytest` framework.
3.  **Black Box:** Test only the public interface described in the Acceptance Criteria. Do not assume internal implementation details.
4.  **Fail First:** The test MUST fail because the implementation does not exist yet. However, it must be *valid code* (importing expected modules) that fails with `ImportError` or `AssertionError`, not `SyntaxError`.
5.  **Mocking:** If the story involves external systems (APIs, DBs), use `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`.

**Story Definition:**
{{story_json}}

**Design Context:**
{{design_content}}

**Output Format:**
Return the Python code block directly.
